\section{Stakeholders}
  \subsection{Users}
    \par It is obvious that this app is designed for everyone around the world. All you need is a smartphone or a wearable device to install the app. At the time when the pandemic seems to be out of control, this app is a considerable solution that helps users gain more understanding of their health conditions. It cannot be denied that when the scene is extremely dangerous, social distancing is one of the best solutions to prevent the virus from spreading. However, there are some situations that people must go outside such as grocery shopping or medical appointments \parencite{Stake1}. It is impossible to lock yourself inside your house 24/7. This app will help to track all other people that the user has been in contact with when they were outside. Although the number of people might be modest thanks to social distancing, prevention is still compulsory. Moreover, there are specific jobs that people cannot work from home. People may be working in public services, in retail, in vital parts of the manufacturing sector or for the governments \parencite{Stake2}. These paramount jobs cannot be converted instantly into homeworking. Therefore, there will still be several people heading out for works facing a high risk of infection. This app will support those people by storing the data of everyone they have met at the workplace or on the way to work.
  \subsection{Doctors/Nurses}
    \par Doctors and nurses probably benefit a lot from this app. The more we prevent the virus from spreading, the less the pressure on them. In countries which are facing the pandemic like Italy, doctors have to make heartbreaking decisions about who receives the treatment and who is abandoned \parencite{Stake3}. Furthermore, because of the sudden rise in the number of infected cases, there is not enough equipment for health workers \parencite{Stake4}. Consequently, many of them are risking their lives curing patients. Healthcare workers are influential in the war with pandemics and protecting them should be the number one priority. If they are infected, they must be isolated for at least 14 days, which will deplete the already exhausted workforce \parencite{Stake5}. By reducing the number of cases, doctors will be in contact with fewer infected patients. Finally, the situation of the pandemic is serious does not mean that we neglect patients with other sicknesses.
  \subsection{Governments/Health Departments/Health Organizations}
  \par It cannot be denied that governments play an important role in stopping the spread of pandemics. They are the frontline and their decisions highly influencing the fight against the epidemics. The governments have adopted some regulations like social distancing to protect and support their people. It is the governmentsâ€™ responsibility to track the virus and put an end to it. With this app, they can easily find out who the infected patient has been in contact with instead of inquiring him/her. The results came out from investigating infected patients might be inaccurate due to the unstable health condition of them. Another problem that the governments and health departments are facing during the pandemic outbreak is the shortage of hospital beds. For instance, in the US, many hospitals have become overloaded \parencite{Stake6}. Based on overseas experience, about one-fifth of people infected with COVID-19 need hospital care and 5\% will need intensive care because of their critical health status \parencite{Stake3}. Therefore, if the coronavirus keeps spreading with the ongoing rate, the number of infected patients will exceed the number of available beds soon. In response, the governments have built more field hospitals which only cure COVID-19 patients. As proof, a dedicated coronavirus field hospital is being built in Canberra which could cost more than \$23 million \parencite{Stake7}. This application helps to reduce the number of infected cases also means that governments can save a lot of money.
  \par Our app is designed to track and store all the data of people whom users have been in contact during the plague. In other words, our application is mediated between governments and users. Governments and Health Department have access to the database so that they can select which users are most likely to be infected. After that, our application will be the means of communication for the government to connect with those users.
  \par This application also needs the cooperation of the Health Organization or Health Department to obtain all the information about the current pandemic (namely symptoms, how it spreads, how to protect yourself, etc.). With these data, the application can adapt and use the most effective tracking method.
