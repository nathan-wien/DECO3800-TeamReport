\section{Introduction}
  \par In this first iteration - Problem Identification - of the on-going assessment report of the course DECO3800 - Proposal, we direct our concentration towards the problem space of pandemic outbreak, namely COVID-19 as of the reality right now, and how a contact tracing application system can remarkably help flatten the curve of infection rate.
  \par Throughout the report, we will discuss multiple aspects of the issue, which have all been organized into concrete headings. Nevertheless, our current main focus is doing background research on the virus and any existing technology-aided countermeasures, checking what questions we still need to answer, and planning how we will answer them to progress further in this project.
