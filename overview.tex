\section{Overview}
  \subsection{Motivation}
    \par The current COVID-19 virus pandemic we are experiencing is critically dangerous not only because it causes pneumonia to the victims but it is also fully capable of dispersing from human hosts without them even know they have already been infected.
    \par Without proper population control measures, the curve of infection rate can rise steeply, eventually up to a point that may as well compromise the entire health care systems/resources we have got.
    \par Therefore, controlling the spread of the virus is a must if we do not want to reach the point of no going back in this global pandemic catastrophe. And the best measure we have got in our hands now is contact tracing.
  \subsection{The Project and Overall Aims}
    \par Developing a mobile application that can keep logs of who the user has met and where the user has been to so that in case someone is diagnosed positive with the virus, anyone who has been in close contact with this person is put under surveillance and any places this person has been to can be considered going into lockdown for disinfection.
    \par Possible technologies applied: Bluetooth signals, GPS services
    \par Overall Aims:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Quickly track down individuals with a high chance of being infected and prevent further spreading of the virus
      \item Ensure that people receive the required care from health organizations in a timely manner as well as preserve privacy for the users of the application
      \item Being a channel for organizations with authority to issue important announcements and credible/factual information to the wider public
    \end{itemize}
